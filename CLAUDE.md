## What this repository is

SuperOPC is a **content/plugin repository** with a **Python engine layer**, not a standalone application service. The main deliverables are:
- markdown-based **skills** in `skills/`
- markdown-based **agents** in `agents/` with capability registry `agents/registry.json`
- slash-command entrypoints in `commands/opc/`
- quality gates in `hooks/hooks.json` + `scripts/hooks/*.py`
- reusable engineering rules in `rules/`
- reference docs in `references/`
- format export tooling in `scripts/convert.py`
- **v2 engine layer** in `scripts/engine/` — event bus, state engine, DAG orchestrator, decision engine, cruise controller, profile engine, learning store, context assembler, notification dispatcher, and scheduler

Most changes in this repo are documentation and workflow changes; the main executable code is the hook scripts, the format converter, and the v2 engine modules.

## Core repository guidance

- Treat this repo as a **one-person company operating system** for solo founders: product, engineering, business, and market-intelligence workflows live side by side.
- Existing repo guidance is **skill-first**: if a relevant skill exists, prefer the skill-driven workflow over ad-hoc behavior.
- [!!CRITICAL RED FLAG!!] **Anti-Build-Trap Guardrail (Minimalist Entrepreneur):** Before executing any code generation for a new product/feature idea, you MUST route through the `business-advisory` skill → `opc-business-advisor` agent, which enforces `validate-idea` + `find-community` sub-activities from `references/business/` before permitting construction.
- Feature work pipeline: `planning -> implementing -> reviewing -> shipping`（`planning` skill 已吸收旧 brainstorming 的需求澄清）.
- Bug work: `debugging skill -> opc-debugger (hypothesis-evidence-elimination) -> calls tdd skill in fix phase`.
- TDD is a repo-level expectation for behavior-changing work; `rules/common/testing.md` sets an **80% coverage target** and documents the RED/GREEN/REFACTOR loop.
- Commits are expected to use **Conventional Commits**; `rules/common/git-workflow.md` also forbids bypassing hooks with `--no-verify`.
- `AGENTS.md` instructs Claude to delegate proactively to specialist agents via `dag_engine.py` (v2) for planning, execution, review, verification, debugging, security review, and documentation.

## Common commands

### Install / use as a Claude Code plugin
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjts/superopc.git
```

This repo is the **plugin source repository** for SuperOPC.

It is not yet published in a Claude Code-discoverable marketplace, so do **not** claim that users can install it with:
```text
/plugin install superopc
```

When the separate marketplace repository is live and verified, the expected end-user flow will be:
```text
/plugin marketplace add gjts/superopc-marketplace
/plugin install superopc@superopc-marketplace
```

### Generate integrations for other tools
```bash
python scripts/convert.py --tool cursor
python scripts/convert.py --tool windsurf
python scripts/convert.py --tool gemini-cli
python scripts/convert.py --tool opencode
python scripts/convert.py --tool openclaw
python scripts/convert.py --tool all
python scripts/convert.py --help
```

### Development reality for this repo

- `Python 3.11+` is required for `scripts/convert.py`, `scripts/opc_*.py`, and the hook scripts (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- There is currently **no repo-root `package.json`, Makefile, or dedicated build/lint/test script** for this repository itself.
- There is therefore **no repo-specific single-test command** to document right now.
- Validation is mainly done by checking:
  - markdown/frontmatter correctness
  - plugin manifest wiring
  - hook registration in `hooks/hooks.json`
  - repo / project health checks via `scripts/opc_quality.py` and `scripts/opc_health.py`
  - generated output under `integrations/` when converter behavior or source content changes

## High-level architecture

### 0. Engine layer (v2) — the autonomous nervous system
`scripts/engine/` is the new runtime core that turns SuperOPC from a passive prompt collection into an active system:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `event_bus.py` | Publish/subscribe event bus — all internal communication goes through here |
| `state_engine.py` | Structured `.opc/` state with JSON+MD dual-write and event emission |
| `dag_engine.py` | DAG orchestrator v2 — resilient wave execution with retry/degrade/escalate |
| `decision_engine.py` | Three-layer brain: rule engine → state machine → ICE heuristics |
| `cruise_controller.py` | Autonomous operation with watch/assist/cruise modes |
| `scheduler.py` | Background cron for health checks, intel refresh, session recovery |
| `profile_engine.py` | 8-dimension developer profiling across sessions |
| `learning_store.py` | Cross-project knowledge persistence at `~/.opc/learnings/` |
| `context_assembler.py` | Dynamic context construction — phase-aware skill/agent/rule selection |
| `notification.py` | Multi-channel alerts: file, webhook, desktop, email |

Data flow: `Perception (events) → EventBus → DecisionEngine → DAGEngine → Agents → QualityGate → StateEngine → EventBus (loop)`

### 1. Commands are the user-facing entrypoints
`commands/opc/*.md` defines the 25 top-level slash commands. v1.4.2 classifies them into three tiers by contract:

**Dispatcher commands (16)** — must dispatch a dispatcher skill, not call scripts directly:
`/opc` `/opc-start` `/opc-plan` `/opc-build` `/opc-review` `/opc-ship` `/opc-debug` `/opc-security` `/opc-business` `/opc-progress` `/opc-pause` `/opc-resume` `/opc-session-report` `/opc-cruise` `/opc-heartbeat` `/opc-autonomous`

**Local runtime CLI (6)** — whitelisted to invoke `python scripts/*.py` or `bin/opc-tools` directly for low-friction local actions:
`/opc-health` `/opc-dashboard` `/opc-stats` `/opc-intel` `/opc-profile` `/opc-research`

**Mixed low-friction CLI (3)** — list mode is read-only, create mode writes a single markdown entry to `.opc/<dir>/` and emits stderr advisory:
`/opc-thread` `/opc-seed` `/opc-backlog`

The contract is mechanically enforced by `scripts/verify_command_contract.py` in CI (see AGENTS.md §本地 runtime 白名单例外).

### 2. Skills are the discovery + atomic-technique layer (v1.4.2 — 17 skills)

Starting in v1.3 and sharpened in **v1.4**, SuperOPC enforces a strict **skill-dispatcher / agent-workflow** contract. skill 空间只保留真正驱动 agent workflow 的入口 + 被 agent 调用的刚性原子技术 + 系统元层规则。Knowledge-base content (technical patterns / business playbooks) has been sunk into `references/`.

**Dispatcher skills** (≤ 60 lines each, **10 total**) — auto-trigger entries that delegate to an agent. They own the `description` that Claude's auto-discovery matches, and their job is to `Task()` the corresponding agent. They do NOT contain workflow steps, review rubrics, or templates.

- `skills/product/planning/` → dispatches `opc-planner` (**吸收了旧 brainstorming**，Phase 0-5 完整流程)
- `skills/product/implementing/` → dispatches `opc-executor`
- `skills/product/reviewing/` → dispatches `opc-reviewer` (with Quick/Standard/Deep depth)
- `skills/product/shipping/` → dispatches `opc-shipper`
- `skills/engineering/debugging/` → dispatches `opc-debugger`
- `skills/engineering/security-review/` → dispatches `opc-security-auditor`
- `skills/business/advisory/` → dispatches `opc-business-advisor` (**v1.4 新增**，一人公司商业活动统一入口)
- `skills/using-superopc/workflow-modes/` → dispatches `opc-orchestrator` for 7-mode routing
- `skills/using-superopc/session-management/` → dispatches `opc-session-manager` (**v1.4.2 升级**，pause/resume/progress/session-report 四子场景)
- `skills/using-superopc/autonomous-ops/` → dispatches `opc-cruise-operator` (**v1.4.2 升级**，cruise/heartbeat/autonomous-advance + GREEN/YELLOW/RED zones + Anti-Build-Trap guardrail)

**Rigid atomic skills** (4 total) — self-contained reusable techniques invoked from within agents:

- `skills/engineering/tdd/` — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR discipline
- `skills/engineering/verification-loop/` — 4-layer verification + Nyquist sampling
- `skills/engineering/agent-dispatch/` — subagent dispatch with 2 modes
- `skills/engineering/git-worktrees/` — isolated workspace

**Meta skills** (2 total) — system-level runtime rules consumed by decision engine / cruise controller / hooks, never user-invoked:

- `skills/using-superopc/SKILL.md` — meta-skill that bootstraps the whole system (skill discovery protocol)
- `skills/using-superopc/developer-profile/` — 8-dimension profiling across sessions (engine-consumed)

**Learning skill** (1 total):

- `skills/learning/continuous-learning/` — PostToolUse observation pipeline + instinct evolution

**Knowledge base sunk to `references/` (v1.4 change):**

- `references/patterns/engineering/*.md` — 13 technical-stack patterns (nextjs / dotnet / postgres / docker / kotlin-compose / api-design / ADR / codebase-onboarding / database-migrations / deployment / e2e-testing / frontend / backend)
- `references/business/*.md` — 19 solo-founder playbooks (pricing, mvp, validate-idea, first-customers, find-community, processize, seo, content-engine, brand-voice, marketing-plan, grow-sustainably, user-interview, investor-materials, legal-basics, finance-ops, company-values, product-lens, daily-standup, minimalist-review)
- `references/intelligence/*.md` — market-research / follow-builders (referenced by `opc-researcher`)
- `references/review-rubric.md` — 5-dimension rubric + Quick/Standard/Deep depth (referenced by `opc-reviewer`)
- `references/security-checklist.md` — OWASP Top 10 full checklist (referenced by `opc-security-auditor` and `opc-reviewer` Deep)
- `references/skill-authoring.md` — skill author handbook (merged from former `skill-from-masters` + `writing-skills`)

When understanding SuperOPC behaviour: for a **workflow activity** (plan/build/review/ship/debug/security/business-advise), the authoritative source is the **agent** file. For an **atomic technique** (TDD, dispatch, verification, worktrees), the authoritative source is the **atomic skill**. For **reference content** (framework patterns, playbooks, rubrics, checklists), the authoritative source is `references/`.

### 3. Agents are the workflow owners

`agents/` contains **27 registered specialist roles** (20 core, 2 matrix, 5 domain). Under the v1.3 dispatcher pattern sharpened in v1.4 and extended in v1.4.2 (adding `opc-session-manager` for pause/resume/progress/session-report and `opc-cruise-operator` for cruise/heartbeat/autonomous-advance), **each agent is the single source of truth for its workflow** — planner owns planning, executor owns implementation, reviewer owns review, shipper owns release, business-advisor owns commercial decisions, session-manager owns session continuity, cruise-operator owns autonomous operations.

`agents/registry.json` provides a capability-based routing registry that the DAG engine uses for task-to-agent matching, with keyword fallback only when capability tags/scenarios do not match. `AGENTS.md` defines the intended orchestration patterns, including the main product pipeline (planning → implementing → reviewing → shipping) plus dedicated debugging, security-review, business-advisory, and autonomous-operation flows.

### 4. Rules and references are the quality system
- `rules/common/` applies across the repo
- `rules/typescript/` is the language-specific layer for `.ts` / `.tsx`
- `rules/csharp/` is the language-specific layer for `.cs`
- `references/` contains the supporting docs for gates, verification patterns, anti-patterns, TDD, git integration, and context budgeting

When changing implementation guidance or quality expectations, update the matching `rules/` or `references/` doc rather than scattering the same policy across many skills.

### 5. Hooks enforce guardrails around Claude tool use
`hooks/hooks.json` registers Claude Code hooks, and `scripts/hooks/*.py` contains the implementations.

Current hook coverage includes:
- blocking `git --no-verify`
- commit quality / secret scanning
- read-before-edit reminders
- config-protection warnings
- prompt-injection scanning for writes
- bash command audit logging
- console-log warnings after edits
- git-push reminders
- session summary persistence on stop

The repo docs describe these hooks as **advisory-first**: most warn rather than block, except for higher-severity checks.

### 6. `scripts/convert.py` republishes the repo to other ecosystems
`scripts/convert.py` is the main executable in the repo. It reads source content from:
- `skills/`
- `agents/`
- `commands/opc/`

…and writes derived artifacts to `integrations/<tool>/` for:
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Gemini CLI
- OpenCode
- OpenClaw

`integrations/` should be treated as **generated output**, not the canonical source of truth.

### 7. Plugin metadata controls what Claude Code actually ships
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the plugin manifest used by Claude Code
- marketplace metadata for end-user installation should live in a **separate marketplace repository**, not in this plugin source repo

The plugin manifest should stay aligned with the full shipped agent set in `agents/`. If you add or rename an agent, update `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` in the same change.

## Workflow artifacts and expectations

- `/opc-plan` runs the unified planning flow (Phase 0-5 in `opc-planner`, covering both clarification and decomposition) and outputs a `PLAN.md` artifact (the command docs refer to `docs/plans/`).
- `/opc-build` consumes a `PLAN.md`, executes tasks with TDD, and produces `SUMMARY.md`.
- `/opc-ship` verifies tests, summarizes changes, and handles merge / PR / keep / discard flows.
- `/opc-health` validates `.opc` integrity, requirements coverage, summary traceability, plugin / hook wiring, and internal markdown links; `--repair` remains a guarded local-runtime fix path.
- `/opc` is the natural-language entry; it dispatches `workflow-modes` skill which routes among 7 modes (watch / assist / cruise / fast / quick / discuss / explore). The reduced-ceremony quick path (no formal `PLAN.md`, still keeps TDD + atomic-task execution) is now reached via `/opc <natural-language>` → orchestrator → quick mode rather than a dedicated `/opc-quick` command.
- `/opc-debug` (v1.4.2): dispatches `debugging` skill → `opc-debugger` for 4-stage root-cause analysis.
- `/opc-security` (v1.4.2): dispatches `security-review` skill → `opc-security-auditor` for OWASP Top 10 audit.
- `/opc-business` (v1.4.2): dispatches `business-advisory` skill → `opc-business-advisor` with Anti-Build-Trap HARD-GATE.
- `/opc-cruise` / `/opc-heartbeat` / `/opc-autonomous` (v1.4.2): dispatch `autonomous-ops` skill → `opc-cruise-operator` for bounded autonomous operation.
- `/opc-pause` / `/opc-resume` / `/opc-progress` / `/opc-session-report` (v1.4.2): dispatch `session-management` skill → `opc-session-manager` for session continuity.

If you are changing these workflows, make sure command docs, relevant skills, and agent expectations stay aligned.

## Editing guidance specific to this repo

- Prefer editing the **source-of-truth** files in `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `rules/`, `references/`, and `scripts/`.
- Avoid hand-editing `integrations/` unless you are intentionally changing generated output or debugging the converter.
- Keep markdown frontmatter accurate; `name` and `description` are used by discovery/conversion flows.
- If you add or rename commands, agents, or skills, check whether `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, or generated integrations also need updates.
- When editing repo policy, prefer updating the single authoritative location (for example `rules/common/testing.md` for testing policy or `hooks/hooks.json` for hook wiring) instead of duplicating the same rule in many places.

## SuperOPC Behavior Protocol (v2)

These rules are internalized from 9 upstream projects and enforced by the decision engine:

1. **[Superpowers] SKILL-FIRST** — If a relevant skill exists, invoke it, even with 1% applicability.
2. **[GSD] CONTEXT-DECAY-DEFENSE** — Monitor context budget; degrade gracefully at 80% usage.
3. **[ECC] CONTINUOUS-LEARNING** — After every session, capture insights to `~/.opc/learnings/`.
4. **[Minimalist Entrepreneur] ANTI-BUILD-TRAP** — No code generation without `validate-idea` + `find-community` evidence.
5. **[Superpowers] TDD-IRON-LAW** — No production code without a failing test first.
6. **[GSD] WAVE-EXECUTION** — Parallelize independent tasks; serialize dependent ones.
7. **[Agency-Agents] NEXUS-PROTOCOL** — Consult specialist agents for domain-specific work.
8. **[Follow Builders] BUILDER-INTEL** — Check builder feeds before market validation.
9. **[skill-from-masters] METHODOLOGY-FIRST** — Align with proven expert methodologies before creating new skills.
10. **[last30days] MULTI-SOURCE** — Use multiple data sources for market assessment.
11. **[Claude Code Best Practice] ATOMIC-COMMITS** — One task = one commit.

## Autonomous operations (v2)

SuperOPC can operate in three autonomous modes via `/opc-cruise`:
- **Watch**: Monitor only, alert on anomalies
- **Assist**: Execute GREEN zone tasks (health, tests, docs, intel), pause on YELLOW/RED
- **Cruise**: Execute GREEN + YELLOW tasks, pause only on RED zone (deploy, migrations, security, payments)

The decision engine (`scripts/engine/decision_engine.py`) determines actions through three layers:
1. Rule engine (deterministic patterns)
2. State machine (phase-aware flow)
3. ICE heuristics (prioritized scoring)
